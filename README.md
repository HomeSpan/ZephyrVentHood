# ZephyrVentHood
 
HomeKit control of a ceiling-mounted <a href="https://zephyronline.com/product/lux-island-range-hood/">Lux Island</a> kitchen vent hood fan by Zephyr.  Runs on an ESP32 device as an Arduino sketch using the Arduino [HomeSpan Library](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan).

Hardware used for this project:

* An ESP32 board, such as the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 ‚Äì ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh9-Rk4nx7QIVEvDACh0IRwiGEAYYBiABEgJSMPD_BwE)
* A simple 434 MHz RF Transmitter, such as this [RF Link Transmitter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10534) from SparkFun
* A simple 434 MHz RF Receiver (to reverse-engineer the remote signals), such as this [RF Link Receiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10532) from SparkFun
* Three pushbuttons (normally-open)

Though the Lux Island Vent Fan is a rather esoteric appliance, the Arduino sketch used to control it is quite generic and can be readily modified to control any simple multi-button RF device that uses fixed codes (for an example of implementing rolling codes with HomeSpan, see my "universal" [Somfy Motorized Window Shade Controller](https://github.com/HomeSpan/SomfyRTS)).  More so, as described fully below, this appliction shows how real-world appliances don't always fit neatly into the ideal way HomeKit models the world.  To work around these limitations the sketch uses some internal state variable that allow one HomeKit Service to control another so that the status of the device in your Home App properly reflects the actual status of the appliance.  

### The Zephyr Kitchen Vent Hood with LED Lights

As part of a kitchen remodel we selected a <a href="https://zephyronline.com/product/lux-island-range-hood/">Lux Island</a> vent hood fan by Zephyr to install in the ceiling over a kitchen island cooktop.  The hood contains a very powerful 3-speed fan and sports LED lights to illuminate the cooking area below with 3 levels of brightness.  Since the fan is mounted directly in the ceiling, there are no manual controls or buttons to turn it on or off.  Instead, Zephyr provides this stylistic RF remote control you're supposed to place on your countertop:

As shown, it's a simple 4-button remote with buttons for power, the fan, the lights, and a timer control.  Unfortunately, it uses a psuedo-touch sensitive mechanism that is so finicky that there is only a 5% chance that it registers when you press the button.  A replacement remote from the manufacturer performed even worse and it was nearly impossible to get the remote to detect when you pressed one of the buttons.  This project was thus designed to both replace the Zephyr remote with a more robust device, as well as to provide HomeKit control so that you can activate the vent fan and light using Siri (useful when your hands are busy cooking and a pan starts to smoke).

### The RF Signals

Opening the remote revealed it was using a standard 433.92 MHz oscillator (it was printed on the oscillator itself).  Using an Arduino Mega, the Arduino Serial Plotter (a terrific feature of the Arduino IDE!), and a 434 MHz receiver allows or an easy reverse-engineering of the RF signals.  

Each button on the remote produces 8 repeats of a fixed pattern of 20 high/low pulses. Individual high/low pulses are 850ùõçs in duration, and there is a delay of 4ms between repeats of the pattern.  There are two types of pulses:  one is 230ùõçs high followed by 620ùõçs low, which can be arbitrarily assigned to represent a 0-bit; the other is 620ùõçs high followed by 230ùõçs low, which would represent a 1-bit.  Each button can therefore be represented by a 5 hex-digit code, such as 0x51388.

### Generating the RF Codes

The sketch uses HomeSpan's `RFControl` library to output a digital version of specific 20-bit patterns on a pin that is connected to the input of a 434 MHz transmitter.  To create an RF signal corresponding to one of the buttons on the remote control, the code loads 20 high/low pulses into the ESP32's dedicated RMT (Remote Control) Memory using either an `add(230,620)` to represent a 0-bit or an `add(620,230)` to represent a 1-bit.  To create the 4ms delay between repeats of the pattern, the sketch adds an additional 4000 ticks to the second argument of the last bit loaded, yielding either an `add(230,4620)` or an `add(620,4230)` depending on whether the last bit was a 0 or 1.  The sketch then calls `start(8,1)`, which directs the ESP32 to generate 8 repeats of the preloaded pattern with 1 tick = 1 microsecond.

### Real-World Complications in the Idealized-World of HomeKit

The Zephyr Vent Hood has both a fan and a light, which should in principle be easy to replicate as a single Accessory with one Fan Service (with 3 speeds) and one Light Bulb Service (with 3 levels of brightness).  Unfortunately, the Zephyr Hood controls are not as clean, and the the Fan and Light operations are somewhat linked together as follows:

If both the fan and light are off:

* a press of the power button turns on the fan to low speed; or
* a press of the fan button turns on the fan to low speed; or
* a press of the light button turns on the light to high brightness.

Pressing the light button when the light is already on cycles the brightness high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low ‚Üí off, and then back to high.  Pressing the fan button when the fan is already running cycles the speed low ‚Üí medium ‚Üí high, and then back to low.  **There is *no* off setting when pressing the fan button**.  Instead, to turn the fan off, you need to press the power button.  But that also turns off the light, which leads to a linkage between the fan and light that is more complex than the idealized standalone Fan and Light Bulb Service in HomeKit.  For example, if the fan is off *and* the light is off, the fan comes on when you press the power button.  But if the light is already on and you press the power button, the light turns off, and nothing happens to the fan.

A second complication is that the Zephyr only allows you to cycle through speeds and brightness levels.  There is no remote control command that directs the Zephyr to set the fan to a specific speed or the light to a specific brightness.

Fortunately, a little bit of extra logic that takes advantage of Homespan's flexible service-oriented structure, and some practical compromise, is all that is needed to solve for these complications.

### Implementing the Code

The code uses HomeSpan to implement a Fan Service and LightBulb Service.  Both Services are configured only for on/off functionality; there is no speed control for the fan, and no brightness control for the light.  Instead, fan speed and light brightness is controlled to two separate pushbuttons implemented using HomeSpan's `SpanButton()` object.

The Fan Service is programmed to send the RF signal corresponding to the fan button on the Zephyr remote control when the user requests the fan to turn on.  This causes the Zephyr Vent Hood to set the fan to low speed, but has no effect on the light.  Requests to turn on the fan when the fan is already on are ignored.  This is because sending another RF fan signal would change the speed instead.

Similarly, the LightBulb Service is programmed to send the RF signal corresponding to the light button on the Zephyr remote control when the user requests the light to turn on.  This causes the Zephyr Vent Hood to set the light to high brightness, nbut has no effect on the fan.  Requests to turn on the light when the light is already on are ignored.  This is because sending another RF light signal would change the brightness of the light, including possibly shutting it off, depending on its current brightness level, which is the opposite of what the user intended.

Both the Fan and LightBulb service are programmed to send the RF signal corresponding to the power button on the Zephyr remote control when the user requests either to be turned off.  Since this RF signal causes the Zephyr Vent Hood to turn off both the Fan and the Light (provided at least one of them are on), the `update()` method for each Service includes logic to set a global boolean variable that is monitored in the `loop()` method of the other Service.  For example, when the user requests the fan to be turned off, the `update()` method in the Fan Service sends the RF power button signals and sets the boolean variable `resetLight` to `true`.  The LightBulb Service monitors this variable in its `loop()` function, and if true it simply resets its status to off with the `setVal()` method.  HomeSpan automatically sends an event notificaton to HomeKit when `setVal()` is used so that HomeKit will properly reflect the fact that the light is now off.  This same logic also applies in the other direction, so that if the user requests the light to turn off, the LightBulb Service sends the RF power signals, and sets the boolean variable `resetFan` to `true`.  The Fan Service picks this up in its `loop()` method and changes its state to off with `setVal()`, which also triggers and event notification of the status change back to HomeKit.

Additional logic is added to both Service so that requests to turn off a Service that is already off is ignored.  This is because sending the RF power signal when the service is already off will either cause the other service to turn off (if it is on), or it will turn on both services if both are already off, which is the opposite of the users intention.

The two pushbuttons are programmed to mimic the functionality of the original remote, but with more intuitive logic.  Pressing the fan button when the fan is off sends an RF fan signal so that the Zephyr Vent Hood turns the fan on.  The code within the `button()` method also sets the state of the device to on with the `setVal()` method, which in turn sends an event notification to HomeKit so it also knows the device is on.  Subsequent presses of the fan button cause the Fan Service to send additional RF fan signals so the the fan can cycle speeds from low ‚Üí medium ‚Üí high, and then back to low.  These subsequent presses have no effect on any internal status since HomeKit is not being used to set the speed of the fan.

The light button operates in a similar fashion but requires additional logic since cycling through the different brightness levels includes a "fully off" level.  The LightBulb Service keeps track of this via an internal state variable called `state`.  Whenever the LightBulb Service records a light button press that results in the light cycling from the lowest brightness level to off, it uses `setVal()` to update its status and send a corresponding event notification to HomeKit. 

To turn off the fan or the light with the pushbutton, the Services are programmed to also look for LONG button presses (HomeSpan's `SpanButton` method supports SINGLE, DOUBLE, and LONG button presses).  When it detects a LONG press, it sends the RF power signal to turn off the Zephyr Vent Hood, following the same logic as above so that it only sends the signal if the service is already on.  This same logic also updates the status of the service to off with the `setVal()` method, which causes HomeSpan to send an event notfication of HomeKit.

In this fashion, the on/off status of the fan and the light in HomeKit stays in perfect sync with the actual status of the fan and light on the Zephyr Vent Hood regardless of whether the user operates the fan or light from the Home App, via Siri, or by using the physical pushbuttons.

Though the logic above may seem somewhat complicated, the code itself should be fairly straightforward and in some ways easier to follow.  This sketch is also sufficiently generic and flexible that you should be able to modify it to crete your own custom HomeKit controls for any multi-button remote (either RF or IR) that uses fixed (static) codes.

Happy HomeKitting!
